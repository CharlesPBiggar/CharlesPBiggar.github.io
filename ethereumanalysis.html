                    <hr>
                    <h5>Introduction</h5>
                    <p>
                        Ethereum is one of the most powerful networks in the cryptocurrency world. To put it simply, Ethereum is a software that 
                        is running on a distributed network of computers which ensures that smaller programs are replicated and executed across 
                        the network in a safe but trustless manner. Bitcoin, its predecessor, is notably referred to as “digital gold” and serves 
                        mainly as a store of value or simply a virtual form of currency. If Bitcoin is the gold of the cryptocurrency world, Ethereum 
                        is the oil that machines are powered on. This is what makes Ethereum such an important development in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. 
                        It is a platform instead of just a currency. This model has allowed countless applications and cryptocurrencies to be built upon 
                        the Ethereum network. Ethereum is the most popular ecosystem for decentralized applications. Built on Smart Contracts that allow 
                        these decentralized apps to function in a trustless manner, it is more than just a cryptocurrency it is a thriving network that 
                        encompasses much of cryptocurrency ecosystem.     
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h5>Background</h5>
                    <p>
                        Ethereum first came into the public eye with Vitalik Buterin released the Ethereum Whitepaper, detailing his vision for Ethereum 
                        as an evolution of Bitcoin in 2013. In 2014 at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, the future founders of Ethereum would 
                        come together with Buterin to further debate what Ethereum would become. Many notable players in the space, such as Charles Hoskinson 
                        of Cardano and Gavin Wood of Polkadot, were cofounders of the project that helped Vitalik Buterin bring the vision of Ethereum to life. 
                        Ethereum was first launched in July of 2015. In 2016 there was the infamous DOA hack that resulted in a hard fork which split the network 
                        into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. Since then, Ethereum has seen massive adoption due to its Smart Contracts that have allowed countless 
                        Decentralized Finance (DeFi), cryptocurrency tokens, and countless other projects to develop on this ecosystem at an unprecedented rate. 
                        The DeFi boom in the summer of 2020 saw the largest growth in users flocking onto the Ethereum network to interact with these dApps, and 
                        currently greater than 60% of the tens of billions of financial capital locked into DeFi contracts are based on the Ethereum. Ethereum is 
                        supported by the Ethereum Foundation, but it aims to create one large decentralized virtual machine, running the internet of blockchains.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h5>Consensus Method</h5>
                    <p>
                        Ethereum currently utilizes the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus method. This method uses miners to add new blocks to the blockchain and allows 
                        nodes to come to consensus on the state of all information of the blockchain. In PoW consensus method, miners solve complex computational algorithms 
                        for the “right” to produce the next block and earn a reward for mining the block, to incentivize them to do the “work” and keep the network secure. 
                        Security is done through a decentralized pool of miners, that are always competing to solve the next block and thus would be less able to add an 
                        invalid block to the chain reliability without another miner beating you out. This competition over a decentralized pool of miners is what helps 
                        keep the network secure. 	Roughly every 15 second a new block is added to the blockchain via this PoW method. To consistently create malicious, 
                        yet valid, blocks, you would need over 51% of the network mining power to beat everyone else. You would need a lot of computing power to be able to 
                        do this amount of "work". And the energy spend might even outweigh the gains you would make in an attack. This consensus method is shared by Bitcoin 
                        and has lead to a whole industry surrounding cryptocurrency mining, a very profitable one at that. While PoW is the current model used by Ethereum, 
                        there is a proposed upgrade in the works to migrate Ethereum over to the Proof of Stake (PoS) model in the near future. This will eliminate mining, 
                        which has been seen as an issue due to its high energy use and its relation to global warming. Instead, Validators will secure the network by staking 
                        their Ethereum for a chance to create the next block and earn that block reward. But this upgrade was first proposed in 2017 but has yet to see implementation, 
                        so Ethereum remains a Proof of Work network.  
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h5>Tokenomics</h5>
                    <p>
                        Ethereum (ETH) is the native token for the Ethereum ecosystem. It is used to pay fees for transacting on the Ethereum network, deploying smart contracts 
                        or minting NFTs. Wei is the base unit of Ether. 1 ETH is equivalent to 10^18 wei. Wei is normally referenced in its larger unit gigawei (Gwei), which is 
                        10^9 wei. Gwei is the more commonly used denotation of wei and is referred to as “gas.” Fees on Ethereum are normally quoted in their Gwei value, because 
                        it makes it easier to denote the smaller transactions correctly when translating them to fiat currency. ETH and wei follow a similar principle to the relation 
                        of BTC and satoshi. Ethereum is an inflationary currency as it does not have a fixed supply. Every time a miner adds a block to the chain they are rewarded 
                        with ETH and have minimal incentive to hold the coin compared to a validator in a PoS network. Thus many speculators of ETH are excited for the switch to 
                        Ethereum 2.0 as Validators will have an incentive to hold their ETH, which many believe will help the price of ETH increase to higher levels. With the new 
                        EIP-1559 proposal the ETH might start to be a somewhat deflationary currency. While there still is no fixed supply, this proposal implements burning some of 
                        the transaction fees. And if the laws of supply and demand hold true the speculators of ETH could be very happy with the price action of ETH.  
                    </p>

                    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                    <p>
                        Ethereum is a very exciting platform with a lot of adoption and great potential in the future. It does have some competitors close behind it, like Cardano and their up 
                        and coming release of Smart Contracts on their blockchain. But at present Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency and the largest player in the Decentralized Finance 
                        world. I don't think it will be ecplised soon, but that remains to be seen. As the first Smart Contract platform it has done amazing working bringing the blockchain world 
                        foward. I cannot wait to see what is next for this network!
